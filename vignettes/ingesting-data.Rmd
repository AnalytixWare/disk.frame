Let's set-up `disk.frame`
```r
library(disk.frame)

# set up multiple
setup_disk.frame()
```

One of the most important tasks to perform before using `disk.frame` is to make some `disk.frame`. There are a few functions to help you do that.

Firstly there is the `as.disk.frame()` which allows you to make a `disk.frame` from a `data.frame`, e.g.

```r
flights.df = as.disk.frame(nycflights13::flights)

```

will convert the `nycflights13::flights` `data.frame` to a `disk.frame` somewhere in `tempdir()`. To find out the location of the `disk.frame` use:

```r
attr(flights.df, "path")
```

You can also specify a location to output the `disk.frame` to using `outdir`

```r
flights.df = as.disk.frame(nycflights13::flights, outdir = "some/path.df")
```

it is recommended that you use `.df` as the extension for a `disk.frame`, however this is not an enforced requirement.

However, the one of the reason for `disk.frame` to exist is to handle larger-than-RAM files, hence `as.disk.frame` is all that useful because it can only convert data that can fit into RAM. `disk.frame` comes with a couple more ways to create `disk.frame`.

## Creating `disk.frame` from CSVs
The function `csv_to_disk.frame` can convert CSV files to `disk.frame`. The most basic usage is

```r
some.df = csv_to_disk.frame("some/path.csv", outdir = "some.df")
```

this will convert the `"some/path.csv"` to a `disk.frame`. 

## Multiple CSV files

However, sometimes we have multiple CSV files that you want to read. You can do so by supplying a vector of file paths e.g. from the result of `list.files`

```r
some.df = csv_to_disk.frame(c("some/path/file1.csv", "some/path/file2.csv"))

# or
some.df = csv_to_disk.frame(list.files("some/path"))
```

## Inputing CSV files chunk-wise
The `csv_to_disk.frame(path, ...)` function reads the file located at `path` in full into RAM and sometimes the CSV file may be too large for RAM. In that case you can wish to read the files chunk-by-chunk by using the `in_chunk_size` argument which controls how many rows you read in per chunk

```r
# to read in 1 million (=1e6) rows per chunk
csv_to_disk.frame(path, in_chunk_size = 1e6)
```

## Sharding
One of the most important aspects of `disk.frame` is sharding. One can shard a `disk.frame` at read time by using the `shardby`

```r
csv_to_disk.frame(path, shardby = "id")
```

in the above case, all rows with the same `id` values will end up in the same chunk.


## Just-in-time transformation
Sometimes one may wish to perform some transformation on the CSV before writing out to disk. One can use the `inmapfn` argument to do that. The `inmapfn` comes from INput MAPping FuNction.

```r
csv_to_disk.frame(path, inmapfn = function(chunk) {
  some_transformation(chunk)
})
```

## Reading CSVs from zip files
Often, CSV comes zipped in a zip files. You can use the `zip_to_disk.frame` to convert all CSVs within a zip file

```r
zip_to_disk.frame(path_to_zip_file)
```

The arguments for `zip_to_disk.frame` are the same as `csv_to_disk.frame`'s.


## Using `add_chunk`

What if the method of converting to a `disk.frame` isn't implemented in `disk.frame` yet? One can use some lower level constructs provided by `disk.frame` to create `disk.frame`s. For example the `add_chunk` function can be used to add more chunks to a `disk.frame`, e.g.

```r
a.df = disk.frame() # create an empty disk.frame
add_chunk(a.df, cars) # adds cars as chunk 1
add_chunk(a.df, cars) # adds cars as chunk 2
```

Another example of using `add_chunk` is via `readr`'s chunked read functions to create a delimited file reader

```r
delimited_to_disk.frame <- function(file, outdir, ...) {
  res.df = disk.frame(outdir, ...)
  readr::read_delim_chunked(file, callback = function(chunk) {
    add_chunk(res.df, chunk)
  }, ...)
  
  res.df
}

delimited_to_disk.frame(path, outdir = "some.df")
```

The above code uses `readr`'s `read_delim_chunked` function to read

## Exploiting the structure of a disk.frame

Of course, a `disk.frame` is just a folder with many `fst` files named as `1.fst`, `2.fst` etc. So one can simply create these `fst` files and ensure they have the same variable names and it should work.
