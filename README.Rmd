# Introduction

How can I manipulate structured tabular data that doesn't fit into Random Access Memory (RAM)? Use `{disk.frame}`!

In a nutshell, `{disk.frame}` makes use of two simple ideas

1) split up a larger-than-RAM dataset into chunks and store each chunk in a separate file inside a folder and 
2) provide a convenient API to manipulate these chunks

`{disk.frame}` performs a similar role to distributed systems such as Apache Spark, Python's Dask, and Julia's JuliaDB.jl for *medium data* which are datasets that are too large for RAM but not quite large enough to qualify as *big data* that require distributing processing over many computers to be effective.

## Common questions

### a) What is `{disk.frame}` and why create it?

`{disk.frame}` is an R package that provides a framework for manipulating larger-than-RAM structured tabular data on disk efficiently. The reason one would want to manipulate data on disk is that it allows arbitrarily large datasets to be processed by R. In other words, we go from "R can only deal with data that fits in RAM" to "R can deal with any data that fits on disk". See the next section.

### b) How is it different to `data.frame` and `data.table`?

A `data.frame` in R is an in-memory data structure, which means that R must load the data in its entirety into RAM. A corollary of this is that only data that can fit into RAM can be processed using `data.frame`s. This places significant restrictions on what R can process with minimal hassle.

In contrast, `{disk.frame}` provides a framework to store and manipulate data on the hard drive. It does this by loading only a small part of the data, called a chunk, into RAM; process the chunk, write out the results and repeat with the next chunk. This chunking strategy is widely applied in other packages to enable processing large amounts of data in R, for example, see [`chunkded`](https://github.com/edwindj/chunked) [`arkdb`](https://github.com/ropensci/arkdb), and [`iotools`](https://github.com/s-u/iotools).

Furthermore, there is a row-limit of 2^31 for `data.frame`s in R; hence an alternate approach is needed to apply R to these large datasets. The chunking mechanism in `{disk.frame}` provides such an avenue to enable data manipulation beyond the 2^31 row limit.

### c) How is `{disk.frame}` different to previous "big" data solutions for R?

R has many packages that can deal with larger-than-RAM datasets, including `ff` and `bigmemory`. However, `ff` and `bigmemory` restrict the user to primitive data types such as double, which means they do not support character (string) and factor types. In contrast, `{disk.frame}` makes use of `data.table::data.table` and `data.frame` directly, so all data types are supported. Also, `{disk.frame}` strives to provide an API that is as similar to `data.frame`'s where possible. `{disk.frame}` supports many `dplyr` verbs for manipulating `disk.frame`s.

Additionally, `{disk.frame}` supports parallel data operations using infrastructures provided by the excellent [`future` package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=future) to take advantage of multi-core CPUs. Further, `{disk.frame}` uses state-of-the-art data storage techniques such as fast data compression, and random access to rows and columns provided by the [`fst` package](http://www.fstpackage.org/) to provide superior data manipulation speeds.

### d) How does `{disk.frame}` work?

`{disk.frame}` works by breaking large datasets into smaller individual chunks and storing the chunks in `fst` files inside a folder. Each chunk is a `fst` file containing a `data.frame/data.table`. One can construct the original large dataset by loading all the chunks into RAM and row-bind all the chunks into one large `data.frame`. Of course, in practice this isn't always possible; hence why we store them as smaller individual chunks.

`{disk.frame}` makes it easy to manipulate the underlying chunks by implementing `dplyr` functions/verbs and other convenient functions (e.g. the `map.disk.frame(a.disk.frame, fn, lazy = F)` function which applies the function `fn` to each chunk of `a.disk.frame` in parallel). So that `{disk.frame}` can be manipulated in a similar fashion to in-memory `data.frame`s.

### e) How is `{disk.frame}` different from Spark, Dask, and JuliaDB.jl?

Spark is primarily a distributed system that also works on a single machine. Dask is a Python package that is most similar to `{disk.frame}`, and JuliaDB.jl is a Julia package. All three can distribute work over a cluster of computers. However, `{disk.frame}` currently cannot distribute data processes over many computers, and is, therefore, single machine focused.

In R, one can access Spark via `sparklyr`, but that requires a Spark cluster to be set up. On the other hand `{disk.frame}` requires zero-setup apart from running `install.packages("disk.frame")` or `devtools::install_github("xiaodaigh/disk.frame")`. 

Finally, Spark can only apply functions that are implemented for Spark, whereas `{disk.frame}` can use any function in R including user-defined functions.

### f) How is `{disk.frame}` different from multidplyr, partools and distributedR?

The packages [multidplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/multidplyr) doesn't seem to be disk-focused and hence does not allow arbitrarily large dataset to be manipulated; the focus on parallel processing is similar to disk.frame though. For partools [https://matloff.wordpress.com/2015/08/05/partools-a-sensible-r-package-for-large-data-sets/], it seems to use it's own verbs for aggregating data instead of relying on existing verbs provided by data.table and dplyr. The package [`distributedR`](https://github.com/vertica/DistributedR) hasn't been updated for a few years and also seems to require its own functions and verbs.


# Example usage

## Set-up `{disk.frame}`
`{disk.frame}` works best if it can process multiple data chunks in parallel. The best way to set-up `{disk.frame}` so that each CPU core runs a background worker is by using

```r
setup_disk.frame()

# this allows large datasets to be transferred between sessions
options(future.globals.maxSize = Inf)
```

The `setup_disk.frame()` sets up background workers equal to the number of CPU cores; please note that, by default, hyper-threaded cores are counted as one not two.

Alternatively, one may specify the number of workers using `setup_disk.frame(workers = n)`.

## Quick-start
```{r setup}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(disk.frame))
library(nycflights13)

# this will setup disk.frame's parallel backend with number of workers equal to the number of CPU cores (hyper-threaded cores are counted as one not two)
setup_disk.frame()
# this allows large datasets to be transferred between sessions
options(future.globals.maxSize = Inf)

# convert the flights data.frame to a disk.frame
# optionally, you may specify an outdir, otherwise, the 
flights.df <- as.disk.frame(nycflights13::flights)
```

To find out where the disk.frame is stored on disk:
```{r, dependson='setup'}
# where is the disk.frame stored
attr(flights.df, "path")
```

A number of data.frame functions are implemented for disk.frame

```{r, dependson='setup'}
# get first few rows
head(flights.df)
```

```{r, dependson='setup'}
# get last few rows
tail(flights.df)
```

```{r, dependson='setup'}
# number of rows
nrow(flights.df)
```

```{r, dependson='setup'}
# number of columns
ncol(flights.df)
```

## Example: dplyr verbs

### Group by
Group-by in disk.frame are performed within each chunk, hence a two-stage group by is required to obtain the correct group by results. The two-stage approach is preferred for performance reasons too.

To perform group-by one needs to do it in two-stage approach as the group-by's are performed within each chunk. This will be addressed in a future package called `disk.frame.db`, but for now two-stage aggregation is the best to do group-bys in `{disk.frame}`.
```{r flights_df, dependson='setup'}
flights.df = as.disk.frame(nycflights13::flights)

flights.df %>%
  srckeep(c("year","distance")) %>%  # keep only carrier and distance columns
  chunk_group_by(year) %>% 
  chunk_summarise(sum_dist = sum(distance)) %>% # this does a count per chunk
  collect
```

This is two-stage group-by in action
```{r, dependson='flights_df'}
# need a 2nd stage to finalise summing
flights.df %>%
  srckeep(c("year","distance")) %>%  # keep only carrier and distance columns
  chunk_group_by(year) %>% 
  chunk_summarise(sum_dist = sum(distance)) %>% # this does a count per chunk
  collect %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(sum_dist = sum(sum_dist))
```

Here an example of using `filter`

```{r, dependson='flights_df'}
# filter
pt = proc.time()
df_filtered <-
  flights.df %>% 
  filter(month == 1)
cat("filtering a < 0.1 took: ", data.table::timetaken(pt), "\n")
nrow(df_filtered)
```

You can mix group-by with other dplyr verbs as below

```{r, dependson='flights_df'}
pt = proc.time()
res1 <- flights.df %>% 
  srckeep(c("month", "dep_delay")) %>% 
  filter(month <= 6) %>% 
  mutate(qtr = ifelse(month <= 3, "Q1", "Q2")) %>% 
  chunk_group_by(qtr) %>% 
  chunk_summarise(sum_delay = sum(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE), n = n()) %>% 
  collect %>%
  group_by(qtr) %>% 
  summarise(sum_delay = sum(sum_delay), n = sum(n)) %>% 
  mutate(avg_delay = sum_delay/n)
cat("group by took: ", data.table::timetaken(pt), "\n")

collect(res1)
```

However, a one-stage `group_by` is possible with a `hard_group_by` to first rechunk the disk.frame. This **not** recommended for performance reasons, as it can quite slow.
```{r}
pt = proc.time()
res1 <- flights.df %>% 
  srckeep(c("month", "dep_delay")) %>% 
  filter(month <= 6) %>% 
  mutate(qtr = ifelse(month <= 3, "Q1", "Q2")) %>% 
  hard_group_by(qtr) %>% # hard group_by is MUCH SLOWER but avoid a 2nd stage aggregation
  chunk_summarise(avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  collect
cat("group by took: ", data.table::timetaken(pt), "\n")

collect(res1)
```

## Example: data.table syntax
```{r}
library(data.table)

grp_by_stage1 = 
  flights.df[
    keep = c("month", "distance"), # this analysis only required "month" and "dist" so only load those
    month <= 6, 
    .(sum_dist = sum(distance)), 
    .(qtr = ifelse(month <= 3, "Q1", "Q2"))
    ]

grp_by_stage1
```

The result `grp_by_stage1` is a `data.table` so we can finish off the two-stage aggregation using data.table syntax

```{r}
grp_by_stage2 = grp_by_stage1[,.(sum_dist = sum(sum_dist)), qtr]

grp_by_stage2
```
