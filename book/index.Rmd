# The story of how `disk.frame` came to be
I was working at a one of Australia's largest banks and their shiny new SAS server was experiencing huge instability issues. As a result, we had to SAS on our laptop to perform huge amounts of data manipulation. A simple SQL query can take up wards of 20 minutes.

I had enough.

That's why I created `disk.frame` - a larger-than-RAM data manipulation framework for R.
