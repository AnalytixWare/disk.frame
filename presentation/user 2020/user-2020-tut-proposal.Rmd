## Title

Easy Larger-than-RAM data manipulation with disk.frame

## Audience

The audience will benefit the most from this tutorial if they are familiar with popular R data manipulation framework such as dplyr and data.table. This is because we aim to cover disk.frame which is larger-than-RAM data manipulation framework that is largely based on dplyr and data.table

## Instructor background

I have more than 10 years of experience using R and enterprise data manipulation tools like SAS and SQL. I have experience teaching Data Science courses in R in a group setting. I propose to teach the disk.frame package which I authored. The website I created for diskframe is https://diskframe.com and https://www.linkedin.com/in/daizj/ is my LinkedIn. Here is an R course I wrote https://github.com/xiaodaigh/intro_r_data_science

## Domain

Big Data manipulation for data that doesn't fit into RAM can be easy and fast. 


## Points of appeal (75 words)
Almost R users would have run into the "cannot allocate vector of size xxxB." error at some point. For all most all applications, R loads the data into RAM but RAM is a precious resource and can run out. {disk.frame} solves this issue by providing a framework to manipulate data on disk and minimize RAM usage hence enabling analysis much larger amounts of data than is normally possible.  This will appeal to all R users with the need to manipulate larger and larger amounts of data and are currently using a database or SAS to achieve this.


## Learning objectives: 100 â€“ 200 words
In this tutorial, the user will learn how to use disk.frame effectively to manipulation datasets in the 100GBs size on a single computer. 

This includes being able to
* load large dataset into disk.frame format
* manipulate the large disk.frame files
* summarize the large disk.frame files
* performing sortin and merging and other disk.frame related activities
* understand the pros and cons of disk.frame and know when to use disk.frame
* understand the ins-and-outs of on disk data manipulation frameworks like disk.frame
* be able to apply disk.frame to all data taks

## Computing requirement
The requirement for disk.frame is R 3.4 and the ability to install packages via `install.packages`. A laptop is advised but not necessary.
